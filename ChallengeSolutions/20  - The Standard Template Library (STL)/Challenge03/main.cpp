// Hint: consider using stringstream to process words
// once you read in a line from the file.

// Note: I have provided the basic shell for your program.
// I have also provided the functions that display the maps
// as well as the function that cleans the words read.
// You should call the clean_string function for every word 
// you read from the file.

// Good luck and have fun!!!
// Don't over think this one -- use the STL!
